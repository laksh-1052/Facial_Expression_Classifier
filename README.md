This repository contains code for training a facial classification model using a pre-trained MobileNet model. The goal is to classify facial expressions using a custom dataset and optimize model accuracy through various machine learning techniques.

Features
Pre-trained Model: Utilizes MobileNet as the base model for transfer learning.
Image Transformations: Applies data augmentation and preprocessing techniques to enhance model generalization.
Machine Learning Methods: Implements strategies such as fine-tuning, learning rate adjustment, and regularization to maximize model accuracy.
Evaluation Metrics: Utilizes metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.
